Parrot Pal is an ChatGPT-powered flashcard language generator. The first target language is Japanese <-> English.

Vocabulary and Kanji data is injested from the JMDict XML: https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
This data is used to create an internal term databse with relevant tags, such as term-frequency, type (e.g. noun) and category (e.g. sport).
Users can then add vocab they would like to learn to their personal libraries based on word searches and tag-based category filters. 
After adding words to their library, users can generate custom flashcards for language learning by using a ChatGPT-based flashcard generator. 

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
